## Instructions

For access to the source codes, see files with .R extension placed on [codes folder](https://github.com/Quantalab/Xf-NPlants-2018/tree/master/codes):</b>

<b>[Analysis-1.R](https://github.com/Quantalab/Xf-NPlants-2018/blob/master/codes/Analysis1.R) </b>
<br/> 
```
The code reproduces the confusion matrix of the supplementary Table 4.
```

<b>[Analysis-2.R](https://github.com/Quantalab/Xf-NPlants-2018/blob/master/codes/Analysis2.R) </b><br/>

```
The code reproduces the confusion matrix of the supplementary Table 5.
```
<b>Note:</b> Codes [Analysis-1.R](https://github.com/Quantalab/Xf-NPlants-2018/blob/master/codes/Analysis1.R) and [Analysis-2.R](https://github.com/Quantalab/Xf-NPlants-2018/blob/master/codes/Analysis2.R) reproduce the article spliting the data into two data sets:
<br>
 - 80% of the data collected over two years (2016 and 2017) for each disease severity class selected at random, and the testing or validation sample (TS), with the remaining 20% for testing  the model.

 - 90% of the data collected over two years (2016 and 2017) for each disease severity class selected at random, and the testing or validation sample (TS), with the remaining 10% for testing  the model.
 
 - All analyses were done in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). Prior to running the scripts you may need to install the appropriate packages, all available on the CRAN repository. On the codes the procedure to install packages is indicated. To install, open R and execute the following line of code:
 ```
 if (!require("fmsb")) { install.packages("fmsb"); require("fmsb") }  ### VIF analysis
if (!require("klaR")) { install.packages("klaR"); require("klaR") }  ###Wilks.lambda
if (!require("caret")) { install.packages("caret"); require("caret") }  ###  Partition dataset and model LDA
if (!require("e1071")) { install.packages("e1071"); require("e1071") }  ### SVM model
if (!require("nnet")) { install.packages("nnet"); require("nnet") }  ### NNE model
if (!require("pROC")) { install.packages("pROC"); require("pROC") }  ### ROC AUC analysis
```
<b>[Analysis-3.R](https://github.com/Quantalab/Xf-NPlants-2018/blob/master/codes/Analysis3.R)</b><br/>

```
The code reproduces the confusion matrix between the field evaluation and remote sensing predictions 
vs qPCR tests at two spatial scales:
 - At parcel level (Figure 5).
 - At orchard level (table 6).
```

### .RData Files

The .RData files contain the workspace enviroment during the classification and machine learning algorithms used in this article. This files also save the function and tune parameters performed during classification methods. In addtion, the predictions, the model configuration and the confusion matrix is also stored in the .RData files.

As consecuence of the random selection procedure of data, In order to reproduce exactly the statistical accuracy yielded in Table 4 and Table 5, You will need to use the following .RData files for [Table 4](https://github.com/Quantalab/Xf-NPlants-2018/tree/master/Table_4) and [Table 5](https://github.com/Quantalab/Xf-NPlants-2018/tree/master/Table_4). 

The .RData files contain the statistical procedure used on classification and machine learning algorithms to classify disease incidence and severity using the support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Furthermore, the .RData  files conteins the confusion matrix of each classification and machine learning algorithms.

Prior to running the .RData (as executable file)  you need to install R sofware. Next,download the file and put it in the following path:
```
C:/Data_NaturePlants
```
