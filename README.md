<b>Note:</b> Codes [Analysis-1.R](https://github.com/Quantalab/Xf-NPlants-2018/blob/master/codes/Analysis1.R) and [Analysis-2.R](https://github.com/Quantalab/Xf-NPlants-2018/blob/master/codes/Analysis2.R) reproduce the article spliting the data into two data sets:
<br>
 - 80% of the data collected over two years (2016 and 2017) for each disease severity class selected at random, and the testing or validation sample (TS), with the remaining 20% for testing  the model.

 - 90% of the data collected over two years (2016 and 2017) for each disease severity class selected at random, and the testing or validation sample (TS), with the remaining 10% for testing  the model.

```
The code reproduces the confusion matrix between the field evaluation and remote sensing predictions 
vs qPCR tests at two spatial scales:
 - At parcel level (Figure 5).
 - At orchard level (table 6).
```
